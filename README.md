# challenge-3
CU Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 3
by Andrew Ryan Bader
Due 12/21/22

Purpose:
We considered artibrage opporutunites in Bitcoin and other crypto. Artibrage means to capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in global markets. We will be using Pandas in this challenge. We  worked to sort historical trade data on Bitstamp and Coinbase

We applied 3 phases of financial analysis to determine if arbitrage opportunities existed in the data
1) we collected CSV data in Jupyter notebook file
2) we prepared datasets for analysis by cleaning missing/erroneous data
3) we analyzed data with statistics and visualizations by selecting periods in which to identify arbitrage


The answers to the challenge are in the crypto_arbitrage.ipynb in the starter code folder
